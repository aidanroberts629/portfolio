                        Through this project, I gained great experience with advanced ragdoll physics, AI navigation, level design (I have made Portal 2 and Warcraft III maps before, but not Arena), systems design, and much more.</span>

                    For as long as I can remember, I have loved the Horror genre. Whether it's games, shows, 
                    or movies, I have always been fascinated. I finally decided to bite the bullet and make my own horror game in the absence of full-time junior game design positions. 
                    For this game, there is one main horror entity, the mannequin, which will have different variants. These variants, however, are visually identical, 
                    leading to fear, confusion, and uncertainty as the player attempts to escape the warehouse.</span>
