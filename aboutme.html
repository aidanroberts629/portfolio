                        <br><br>I'm 22 years old majoring in Game Design & Development at Rochester Institute of Technology, and was born and raised in NYC. In terms of programming, I am best with frontend work, and am proficient in C#, C++, Java, HTML,
                        CSS, and JavaScript. In terms of software, there's an extensive list on my Resume, however I mostly have experience in Unity in terms of development platforms (however I am absolutely flexible to learn). I've played multiple games
                        at top rank and professional levels, including Team Fortress 2 and playing D1 Overwatch freshman year here at RIT. This means that on top of coding logic, I know how to balance games to the finest details as well.
