                        <strong><i>I am actively seeking full-time positions for game development teams following my graduation in December 2023.</i></strong>
                        <br><br>I'm 23 years old majoring in Game Design & Development at Rochester Institute of Technology, and was born and raised in NYC. In terms of programming, 
                        I am best with frontend work and I am proficient with an extensive list of languages and software that you can find on my Resume. I believe that one of my 
                        best qualities is my ability to be flexible. This being said and despite my main focus, I am always open to other roles including audio, voice acting, and 
                        game design/balance work. I've played multiple games at top rank and professional levels, including Team Fortress 2, CS:GO, and Division 1 Collegiate 
                        Overwatch here at RIT. This means that aside from formal experience, I have a keen eye for game design/balance at a fundamental level.
