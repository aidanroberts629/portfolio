            <div class="info">This website was created for a major project with a few main requirements, one being to pick the main focus from a few categories.
                From these categories, I chose to create an Audio Visualizer and to make it unique, I made it highly customizable and themed to Overwatch, where you can "Select a Hero" to
                change the full color scheme. It utilizes various web components and was created using HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

            <div class="info">I made this website using the MovieDB API for a major project in a rich media class. There are different filters and search options
                to look up any movie or television show. You can also favorite search results to effectively make your own "WatchList" (hence the name), and
                both favorites and search terms are stored in local storage. The website was created using HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
