            <div class="info">[WORK IN PROGRESS FOR THIS WEBSITE] My main task for my summer 2022 internship working for Partie was to create a Windows application version of <a href="https://partie.com/">Partie's website</a> using my present Unity knowledge. I took it a step further and made it in 3D as both a challenge to myself, and knowing that Unity's 3D space can easily be ported into VR, allowing for hypothetical Metaverse capabilities. I had to do this by using their API and creating Unity C# Post/Get requests.
                <br><br>
                Regardless, with the time I had, this application currently displays a "feed" from their website, and you can use horizontal movement keys to move the character through the feed. It will infinitely load and will always load the most updated posts.
