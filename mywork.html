                and a part time job! This FPS PvE Arena Shooter is the combination of two game ideas that I've had for a while, and it is proof of my design and development skills. I pushed
                myself in many different aspects for this project, having never before worked with AI navigation, ragdoll physics (to this extent), mapmaking (used ProBuilder for the first time,
                although I have made plenty of Portal 2 levels), and more.
