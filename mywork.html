            <div class="info">My main task for my summer 2022 internship working for Partie was to create a Windows application version of Partie's <a href="https://partie.com/">website</a>
                using my present Unity knowledge. I took it a step further and made it in 3D as both a challenge to myself, and knowing that Unity's 3D space can easily be ported into VR,
                allowing for hypothetical Metaverse capabilities. I had to do this by using their API and creating Unity C# Post/Get requests. Regardless, with the time I had, this
                application currently displays a "feed" (infinitely and always updated) from their website.

                From these categories, I chose to create an Audio Visualizer and to make it unique, I made it highly customizable and themed to Overwatch.
                It utilizes various web components and was created using HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
